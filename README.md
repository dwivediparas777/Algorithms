# Algorithms
#Searching algorithms
1. UnOrderedLinearSearch
2. OrderedLinearSearch
3. BinarySearch
4. InterpolationSearch

Each of the algorithm is created as a class with a method named "search" which takes below mentioned parameters as input 
and return index of the element and true/false.
Each "search" method have 3 parameters:
1. arr: Array where lement is to be searched (mandatory)
2. element: Element to be searched (mandatory)
3. display: when true it print (start-index, index getting processed, end-index), false(default)

#Sorting algorithms
1. BubbleSort
2. SelectionSort
3. InsertionSort
4. ShellSort
5. MergeSort
6. QuickSort

Each of the algorithm is created as a class with a method named "sort" which takes below mentioned parameters as input 
and return index of the element and true/false.
Each "sort" methos have 3 parameters:
1. arr: Array where lement is to be searched (mandatory)
2. reverse: when true reverse the list then process, false(default)
3. display: when true it print (array being processed), false(default)
